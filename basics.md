# üòÅ Basics

Of course, every language starts with the basics.

The first thing you have to do is create a new project, to do so:

### Creating your first project.

1- Make a folder anywhere after installing dotlang

2- Open the terminal in that folder you have created

3- type in: `dot new` and output should be:

4- now open `main.dot` in any of your favourite code editors (e.g. VS Code, Notepad++, etc.)

5- you're gonna see the first line `Import-Module .\dot.ps1`, do NOT touch it, this will import dotlang.

6- you're now ready to learn the basics!!
